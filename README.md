### 📘 Overview

> This report presents the findings from a **Deep Learning Assignment** that explores core aspects of neural network design using the **MNIST dataset**.

- Implementation using Python & PyTorch
- Focused on **activation functions** and **network depth**
- Includes **visualizations**, **performance analysis**, and **recommendations**

---

### 🔍 Key Insights

| Topic | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 🚀 **Activation Functions** | **ReLU** solves the vanishing gradient problem and performs better than Sigmoid/Tanh in both speed and accuracy. |
| 🧠 **Network Depth** | Deeper networks offer more representation power. For MNIST, **4–8 layers** gives the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. |

---

### 🧪 Experiments

- Designed multiple neural networks with varying depths
- Compared **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, and **Tanh** functions
- Tracked performance metrics: accuracy, loss, convergence rate
- Visualized training history and final predictions
